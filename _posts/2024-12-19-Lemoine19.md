Electro-magnetic field is boosted to the frame in which electric field vanishes. This frame is not necessarily coincident with the fluid comoving frame unless ideal MHD is assumed. In the particle comoving frame, the kinetic equation is written as


$$
\begin{equation}
\frac{\mathrm{d} \hat{p}^{\hat{a}}}{\mathrm{d}\tau} =
\frac{q}{m} \hat{F}^{\hat{a}} _{\hat{ b}}\hat{p}^{\hat{b}} - \hat{\Gamma}^{\hat{a}}_{\hat{b}\hat{c}}\frac{\hat{p}^{\hat{b}}\hat{p}^{\hat{c}}}{m}
,\end{equation}
$$

where the first term leads to pitch angle diffusion by electromagnetic field tensor, without changing the particle energy. The second term is the local coordinate, which changes with time and accelerates particle. The quantities with hat represent those in local inertial frame of particle. 


$$
\begin{equation}
\Delta p^t(\Delta \tau) = [e^t_{\hat{a}}(\Delta \tau)- e^t_{\hat{a}}(0)]\hat{p}^{\hat{a}}(0) + e^t_{\hat{a}}(\Delta \tau)\int_0^{\Delta\tau} \mathrm{d}\tau_1 \frac{\mathrm d \hat{p}^{\hat{a}}}{\mathrm{d}\tau _1}
\end{equation}
$$

Here the first term describes Fermi acceleration, and second term is the particle kinetic evoution in its local frame. 
$$e^t_{\hat{a}}$$
is the Vierbein of relativistic transformation. 

This framework can reproduce the conclusion of shock acceleration (Section II).
