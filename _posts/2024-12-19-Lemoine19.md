### Kinetic Equation

Electro-magnetic field is boosted to the frame in which electric field vanishes. This frame is not necessarily coincident with the fluid comoving frame unless ideal MHD is assumed. So the author defined a comoving locally inertial frame $$\mathcal{\hat{R}}_u$$ In the particle comoving frame, the kinetic equation is written as


$$
\begin{equation}
\frac{\mathrm{d} \hat{p}^{\hat{a}}}{\mathrm{d}\tau} =
\frac{q}{m} \hat{F}^{\hat{a}} _{\hat{ b}}\hat{p}^{\hat{b}} - \hat{\Gamma}^{\hat{a}}_{\hat{b}\hat{c}}\frac{\hat{p}^{\hat{b}}\hat{p}^{\hat{c}}}{m}
,\end{equation}
$$

where the first term leads to pitch angle diffusion by electromagnetic field tensor, without changing the particle energy. The second term is the local coordinate, which changes with time and accelerates particle. The quantities with hat represent those in local inertial frame of particle. 

#### Spin Connection

The $$\hat{\Gamma}^{\hat{a}}_{\hat{b}\hat{c}}$$ here is the connection of the tetrad, which is defined as $$\hat{\Gamma}^{\hat{a}}_{\hat{b}\hat{c}} =-e_{\hat{b}}^\beta e_{\hat{c}}^\gamma e^{\hat{a}}_{\beta;\gamma}$$, and the $$e^{\hat{a}}_{\beta;\gamma}$$ is covariant derivative of the tetrad. For a simple example, we now assume a flat space-time of both lab frame and LIF, so the tetrad coefficients are just the Lorentz transformation matrix, with $$u^x$$ the only non-zero spatial component of 4-velocity , i.e. 


$$
\begin{equation}
e_\alpha^{\hat{a}} = \Lambda_\alpha^{\hat{a}} = \begin{bmatrix}
u^t&-u^x&0&0&\\
-u^x&u^t&0&0\\
0&0&1&0\\
0&0&0&1
\end{bmatrix}\label{conn}
\end{equation}
$$



and the inverse transformation is obtained by substituting $$-u^x$$ with $$u^x$$. 

Then we can simply compute the coefficients, e.g. 
$$\hat{\Gamma}_{\hat{1}\,\hat{0}}^{\hat{0}} = -e_{\hat{1}}^\beta e_{\hat{0}}^\gamma e^{\hat{0}}_{\beta;\gamma}$$
 Substitute the above \eqref{conn} into this equation, we obtain (for $$\{(\beta, \gamma)\} \in \{(0,0),\,(1,0),\,(0,1),\,(1,1)\}$$)
 $$\hat{\Gamma}_{\hat{1}\,\hat{0}}^{\hat{0}} = -u^xu^tu^t_{,t} + (u^t)^2 u^x_{,t} - (u^x)^2 u^t_{,x} + u^xu^tu^x_{,x}$$. Then we differentiate the normalization of 4-velocity u $$(u^t)^2-(u^t)^2 = 1$$, so $$u^t u^t_{,a} = u^x u^x_{,a}$$ and then simplify the above equation, we get 
 $$\hat{\Gamma}_{\hat{1}\,\hat{0}}^{\hat{0}} = u^x_{,t} + \beta u^x_{,x}$$.

 This is the simplest example of computing the connection coefficient. Though the geometry of lab frame may be non-trivial, the calculation of the connection follows the same procedure. 



### Energy Gain

$$
\begin{equation}
\Delta p^t(\Delta \tau) = [e^t_{\hat{a}}(\Delta \tau)- e^t_{\hat{a}}(0)]\hat{p}^{\hat{a}}(0) + e^t_{\hat{a}}(\Delta \tau)\int_0^{\Delta\tau} \mathrm{d}\tau_1 \frac{\mathrm d \hat{p}^{\hat{a}}}{\mathrm{d}\tau _1}
\end{equation}
$$

Here the first term describes Fermi acceleration, and second term is the particle kinetic evolution in its local frame. \hat{\beta}
$$e^t_{\hat{a}} $$
is the Vierbein of relativistic transformation, which is defined by $$g_{\mu\nu} = e^{\hat{\alpha}}_\mu e^{\hat{\beta}}_\nu \eta_{\hat{\alpha}\hat{\beta}}$$. 

As an application of this framework, the conclusions of shock acceleration could be reproduced (in Section II).
