### Energy-Momentum Tensor

The energy-momentum tensor could be expressed in the following form

$$\begin{equation}
    T^{\mu\nu} = (e+p) u^\mu u^\nu + p \eta ^{\mu\nu},
\end{equation}$$

where $$e$$ is the energy density (internal energy + rest mass), $$p$$ is the pressure, $$u = \gamma( 1,\beta_x,\beta_y,\beta_z)$$ the dimensionless 4-velocity, $$\eta = (-1,1,1,1)$$ the Minkowski metric. 

Eq. (11) and (12) are in the spherical coordinate with angular symmetry. Thus $$\eta = (-1,1,r^2,r^2\sin^2\theta)$$ and $$u = \gamma(1,\beta,0,0)$$. We can now calculate the derivative of the EM Tensor, 

$$\begin{aligned}
    &\partial_0T^{00}  = \frac{\partial (e+p)\gamma^2}{\partial t} - \frac{\partial p}{\partial t}\\
    &\partial_0T^{0r} = \frac{\partial (e+p)\gamma^2 \beta}{\partial t}\\
    &\partial_r T^{r0} = \frac{1}{r^2 } \frac{\partial}{\partial r } \left[r^2 (e+p)\gamma^2\beta\right]\\
    &\partial_r T^{rr} = \frac{1}{r^2 } \frac{\partial}{\partial r } \left[r^2 (e+p)\gamma^2\beta^2\right] + \frac{1}{r^2 } \frac{\partial}{\partial r } \left(r^2p\right)
\end{aligned}$$

From the energy and momentum conservation, i.e. $$\nabla _{\mu} T^{\mu\nu} = 0$$. Sum up the corresponding derivatives, for $$\nu = 0$$, we get 

$$\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial}{\partial t } \frac{e+p\beta^2}{1-\beta^2}+\frac{1}{r^2 } \frac{\partial}{\partial r }\frac{r^2(e+p)\beta}{1-\beta^2}=0,
\end{equation}$$

same as eq. (11).

For $$\nu=1$$,  

$$\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial }{\partial t}\frac{(e+p)\beta}{1-\beta^2}+
    \frac{1}{r^2 } \frac{\partial}{\partial r } \frac{r^2 (e+p)\beta^2}{1-\beta^2} + \frac{\partial p}{\partial r} + \frac{2p}{r}.
\end{equation}$$

There seems to be an additional $${2p}/{r}$$ compared to eq. (12) of BM76.
