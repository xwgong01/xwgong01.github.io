Here the total magnetic field \(\mathbf{B} = \mathbf{B}_z + \mathbf{B}_\perp\). As the mean field is along z axis, there is \(B_\perp/ B_z= \varepsilon \ll 1\). \(\mathbf{v}\) is the perturbed velocity field, which is also of order \(\varepsilon\). In the derivation, full MHD equations are simplified with perturbative method, keeping only the low order terms of \(\varepsilon\).</p> <p>Since \(k_\parallel \ll k_\perp\), the variation along z axis is much slower than perpendicular to the magnetic field. Therefore, \(\partial_\perp \sim 1\) and \(\partial_\parallel \sim \varepsilon\).</p> <p>There are also \(B_\perp \sim \varepsilon,\,\) \(B_\parallel \sim 1+\varepsilon^2, \,\) \(j_\perp \sim \varepsilon^2, \,\) \(j_\parallel \sim \varepsilon, \,\) \(p\sim \varepsilon^2, \,\) \(\rho \sim 1, \,\) \(v\sim \varepsilon, \ ,\) \(\partial_t \sim \varepsilon\).</p> <p>If we write the magnetic field as</p> \[B = \nabla A_z \times \hat{z} + B_z \hat{z}\] <p>and take the divergence, the first term vanishes, and we therefore have the divergence of magnetic field</p> \[\nabla \cdot B = \partial _z B_z \sim \varepsilon^3 \approx 0.\] <p>Integrate the induction equation, one yields</p> \[\frac{\partial }{\partial t} \mathbf{A}\times \hat{z} = -B_z \mathbf{v} + \nabla \phi \times \hat{z} = 0\] <p>we are able to define \(\mathbf{v} = \nabla U\times \hat{z}\), with \(B_z U = \phi\) the gauge potential. Then there is</p> \[\frac{\partial A_z}{\partial t} + \mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla A_z = B_z \frac{\partial U}{\partial z}\] <p>Using \(\mathbf{j} = \nabla \times \mathbf{B}\), and substitute \(\mathbf{B}\) with \(\nabla A_z \times \hat{z} + B_z\hat{z}\), the current could be written as</p> <p>\(j_z = -\nabla^2 A_z,\ \mathbf{j}_\perp = \nabla B_z \times \hat{z} + \nabla_\perp \frac{\partial A}{\partial z}\). Substitute this in the momentum equation, and similar for the induction equation, one can derive the Strauss equations:</p> \[\begin{equation} \begin{aligned} \frac{\partial v}{\partial t} + \mathbf{v}\cdot \nabla_\perp \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{b}\cdot \nabla_\perp \mathbf{b} + B_0 \frac{\partial\mathbf{b}}{\partial z} - \nabla_\perp p + \nu \nabla^2_\perp \mathbf{v},\\ \frac{\partial \mathbf{b}}{\partial t} + \mathbf{v}\cdot \nabla_\perp \mathbf{b} = \mathbf{b}\cdot \nabla_\perp \mathbf{v} + B_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial z} + \eta \nabla^2_\perp \mathbf{b} \end{aligned} \end{equation}\] <p>here \(\mathbf{b}\) is the perturbed magnetic field, \(B_0\) is the mean field. The terms \(\nabla^2_\perp v, \quad \nabla^2_\perp b\) are due to viscosity, which does not appear in the original paper of Strauss.</p> <p>Using the Elsasser variable \(z_\perp^\pm = v_\perp \pm b_\perp\), the Strauss equations can further be simplified as</p> \[\partial_t z^\pm _\perp \mp v_A\nabla _\parallel z^\pm _\perp + z^\mp_\perp \cdot \nabla _\perp z^\pm _\perp = -\nabla_\perp p + \eta \nabla^2_\perp z^\pm _\perp + f^\pm\] <p>with the last term on the rhs the external body force.</p> <p>From the above RMHD equations, one can notice that the Elsasser variable z is the normal coordinate of the system. The solution of each equation without the nonlinear term \(z \cdot \nabla_\perp z\) is a Alfvenic wave packet, with \(z^+\) propagating along and \(z^-\) reverse to the mean field. The MHD turbulence in incompressible plasma can therefore be regarded as encounters of Alfvenic wave packets with opposite propagation direction.</p> <h3 id="goldreich-sridhar-spectrum-critical-balance-and-scale-dependent-anisotropy">Goldreich-Sridhar Spectrum, Critical Balance and Scale-dependent Anisotropy</h3> <p>Consider a wave A interacting with a 2d fluctuation and produces the third wave B, which is called three-wave interaction. In this process, wave vector and frequency are conserved, i.e.</p> \[\begin{aligned} \mathbf{k}_A + \mathbf{k}_{2D} =\mathbf{k}_B\\ \omega^\mp_A + \omega^\pm_{2D} = \omega^\pm{B} \end{aligned}\] <p>Since for 2D perturbation, the parallel wave number is zero, there is \(k_{\parallel, B} = k_{\parallel, A}\) and \(k_{\perp, B} = k_{\perp, A} + k_{\perp, 2D}\). In this way, wave cascade will result in larger \(k_\perp\) and unchanged \(k_\parallel\). In presence of strong mean field, the cascade is anisotropic.</p> <p>But this is based on the assumption that Alfven wave packet exhibit wave-like behavior, i.e. the alfven timescale \(\tau_A \equiv l_\parallel / v_A\) is much shorter than the nonlinear timescale, which could be defined as equivalent to the eddy turnover timescale here, \(\tau_{nl}^\pm \sim \lambda / \delta z^\mp_\lambda\). \(\lambda\) here is the perpendicular scale, and since a wave packet will interact with another opposite propagating wave, the nonlinear timescale depends on how fast the opposite wave passes the scale of interest.</p> <p>Under the anisotropic cascade, \(\lambda\) gets always smaller, while \(l_\parallel\) is kept unchanged (this is indeed not true and will be discussed with more rigor), so eventually the condition \(\tau_A \ll \tau_{nl}\) will no longer be satisfied, and the perturbation resembles isotropic Kolmogorov-like turbulence (detail see Appendix A of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/9811037">Lazarian et al 1999</a>).</p> <p>Critical balance is therefore a natural result, where \(\tau_A \sim \tau_{nl}\). Therefore, the energy flow (or energy dissipation rate) in wavenumber k space is</p> \[\varepsilon^\pm \sim \frac{(\delta z^\pm_\parallel)^2}{\tau_A}\] \[\delta z_\parallel ^\pm = \left(\frac{l_\parallel \varepsilon^\pm}{v_A}\right)^{1/2} \Rightarrow E(k_\parallel) \sim \frac{(\delta z_\parallel ^\pm )^2}{k_\parallel} = \frac{\varepsilon^\pm}{v_A} k_\parallel^{-2}\] <p>In the calculation of \(E\) we have used the fact that z has the dimension of velocity.</p> <p>Now consider the perpendicular nonlinear timescale</p> \[\tau^\pm _{nl}\sim \frac{\lambda}{\delta z^\mp_\lambda},\] <p>and</p> <p>\(\varepsilon^\pm = \frac{(\delta z^\pm_\lambda)^2}{\tau^\pm _{nl}} \Rightarrow \delta z^\pm_\lambda = (\tilde{\varepsilon}^\pm \lambda)^{1/3}, \tilde{\varepsilon} \equiv \frac^2}{\varepsilon^\mp}\).</p> <p>Therefore,</p> \[E(k_\perp) \sim( \tilde{\varepsilon}) ^{2/3} k_\perp^{-5/3}\] <p>and compare these two equations of \(E\), we have the scale-dependent anisotropy \(k_\parallel \propto k_\perp^{2/3}\).</p> <p>Above is the model proposed by <a href="ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000PhRvL..85.4656C/abstract">Goldreich &amp; Sridhar 1995</a>, which agrees with the Kolmogorov 5/3 law, but with anisotropic cascade. The GS95 model, however, is based on the overall mean field. The exact treatment should consider the coarse-grained local magnetic field on scale \(\lambda\). Therefore the anisotropy \(k_\parallel \propto k_\perp^q\) measured in numerical simulations is between \(q = 2/3\) and \(q = 1/2\).</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="reading"/><category term="MHD"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reduced MHD is a simplification of the full MHD equations under assumption of strong unidirectional mean field and incompressibility.

This frame is not necessarily coincident with the fluid comoving frame unless ideal MHD is assumed. So the author defined a comoving locally inertial frame \(\mathcal{\hat{R}}_u\) In the particle comoving frame, the kinetic equation is written as</p> \[\begin{equation} \frac{\mathrm{d} \hat{p}^{\hat{a}}}{\mathrm{d}\tau} = \frac{q}{m} \hat{F}^{\hat{a}} _{\hat{ b}}\hat{p}^{\hat{b}} - \hat{\Gamma}^{\hat{a}}_{\hat{b}\hat{c}}\frac{\hat{p}^{\hat{b}}\hat{p}^{\hat{c}}}{m} ,\end{equation}\] <p>where the first term leads to pitch angle diffusion by electromagnetic field tensor, without changing the particle energy. The second term is the local coordinate, which changes with time and accelerates particle. The quantities with hat represent those in local inertial frame of particle.</p> <h3 id="spin-connection">Spin Connection</h3> <p>The \(\hat{\Gamma}^{\hat{a}}_{\hat{b}\hat{c}}\) here is the connection of the tetrad, which is defined as \(\hat{\Gamma}^{\hat{a}}_{\hat{b}\hat{c}} =-e_{\hat{b}}^\beta e_{\hat{c}}^\gamma e^{\hat{a}}_{\beta;\gamma}\), and the \(e^{\hat{a}}_{\beta;\gamma}\) is covariant derivative of the tetrad. For a simple example, we now assume a flat space-time of both lab frame and LIF, so the tetrad coefficients are just the Lorentz transformation matrix, with \(u^x\) the only non-zero spatial component of 4-velocity , i.e.</p> \[\begin{equation} e_\alpha^{\hat{a}} = \Lambda_\alpha^{\hat{a}} = \begin{bmatrix} u^t&amp;-u^x&amp;0&amp;0&amp;\\ -u^x&amp;u^t&amp;0&amp;0\\ 0&amp;0&amp;1&amp;0\\ 0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;1 \end{bmatrix}\label{conn} \end{equation}\] <p>and the inverse transformation is obtained by substituting \(-u^x\) with \(u^x\).</p> <p>Then we can simply compute the coefficients, e.g. \(\hat{\Gamma}_{\hat{1}\,\hat{0}}^{\hat{0}} = -e_{\hat{1}}^\beta e_{\hat{0}}^\gamma e^{\hat{0}}_{\beta;\gamma}\) Substitute the above \eqref{conn} into this equation, we obtain (for \(\{(\beta, \gamma)\} \in \{(0,0),\,(1,0),\,(0,1),\,(1,1)\}\)) \(\hat{\Gamma}_{\hat{1}\,\hat{0}}^{\hat{0}} = -u^xu^tu^t_{,t} + (u^t)^2 u^x_{,t} - (u^x)^2 u^t_{,x} + u^xu^tu^x_{,x}\). Then we differentiate the normalization of 4-velocity u \((u^t)^2-(u^t)^2 = 1\), so \(u^t u^t_{,a} = u^x u^x_{,a}\) and then simplify the above equation, we get \(\hat{\Gamma}_{\hat{1}\,\hat{0}}^{\hat{0}} = u^x_{,t} + \beta u^x_{,x}\).</p> <p>This is the simplest example of computing the connection coefficient. Though the geometry of lab frame may be non-trivial, the calculation of the connection follows the same procedure.</p> <h2 id="energy-gain">Energy Gain</h2> \[\begin{equation} \Delta p^t(\Delta \tau) = [e^t_{\hat{a}}(\Delta \tau)- e^t_{\hat{a}}(0)]\hat{p}^{\hat{a}}(0) + e^t_{\hat{a}}(\Delta \tau)\int_0^{\Delta\tau} \mathrm{d}\tau_1 \frac{\mathrm d \hat{p}^{\hat{a}}}{\mathrm{d}\tau _1} \end{equation}\] <p>Here the first term describes Fermi acceleration, and second term is the particle kinetic evolution in its local frame. \hat{\beta} \(e^t_{\hat{a}}\) is the Vierbein of relativistic transformation, which is defined by \(g_{\mu\nu} = e^{\hat{\alpha}}_\mu e^{\hat{\beta}}_\nu \eta_{\hat{\alpha}\hat{\beta}}\).</p> <p>As an application of this framework, the conclusions of shock acceleration could be reproduced (in Section II).</p> <h2 id="non-resonant-acceleration">Non-resonant acceleration</h2> <p>The second-order moment has two components, one from frame transformation and the other from particle trajectory.

For simplicity we assume a flat lab frame, and \(u\) is initially along \(x\) direction, so the tetrad is simply Lorentz transformation tensor in x direction. Thus,</p> \[\hat{p}^{\hat{a}}(0)=e_\alpha^{\hat{a}}\, p^a = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} u^t(0)p^0(0) + u^x(0)p^x(0)\\ u^x(0)p^0(0) + u^0(0)p^x(0) \end{array}\right.\] <p>We assume that initial \(p\) is in random direction, so \(\langle {p^{x}}^2\rangle = p^2/3\), and the average of spatial components of \(u^i(\Delta \tau)= u^2/3\) with \(i = x,y,z\). Then the above \(\Delta_0^2 = A_1\gamma^2\beta^2 p^2 + A_2\gamma^4\beta^2 p^2\), where it could be approximated in non-relativistic and ultra-relativistic limits.</p> <p><strong>A problem:</strong> The Lorentz transformation tensor is written as (eq. 3), but when I set \(u^x = u^y = 0\), it cannot degrade to the Lorentz transformation in \(x\) direction.

At this state, the system is extremely sensitive to small fluctuations, which propagates quickly throughout large range and can cause the so called avalanche. They used a sand pile model to explain such picture. Increasing the slope of the sand pile somewhere will cause the pile to slide off once the slope is larger than a critical value. They have found that this picture can explain the commonly observed 1/f noise, and can also applied to explain the Kolmogorov turbulence model. With random fluctuations, the scale of avalanche, along with the avalanche lifetime, follows a power-law distribution. This feature is indicative of the SOC properties of the system.</p> <p>Recently <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16052">Zhang et al. 2024</a> studied the waiting time distribution (WTD) of 147 TeV photons of the Brightes-Of-All-Time gamma-ray burst GRB 221009A, detected by LHAASO KM2A. They have found that the WTD is close to a power-law instead of exponential distribution of independent random events. Also, they have fitted the WT difference with Tsallis q-Gaussian distribution, which also yield a consistent q despite its deviation from the relation with power-law slope. They have concluded that light signals from GRB 221009A is not completely independent, and may exhibit some SOC properties.</p> <h3 id="self-organized-criticality">Self-Organized Criticality</h3> <p>Bak et al. built up a sand pile model and investigated its properties. They assumed that sand has a critical slope \(z_c\), beyond this value the sand will slide down to lower place. For the 1-D case, i.e. sand could only slide in two directions to their neighbor points, there is a minimally stable state, with the same slope \(z_c\) for every points. The minimally stable state is, according to Bak, an attractor of the system. For a system at this state, if another sand grain is dropped on the top of the pile, it will increase the \(z\) at that location where it is dropped, then slide to next point where it again increases the \(z\)… Finally it will fall down to the edge or the slide will stop where \(z&lt;z_c\).</p> <p>However, it’s not the case when extended to 2- or 3-D situations. Since in a multi-dimensional case, each spacial point is in correlation with multiple points, any fluctuation will propagate to their neighbors (i.e. each point has 4 neighbors in 2D case). Therefore, the minimally stable state in the 1D scenario is not stable any more, as any perturbation will trigger an avalanche with the scale of the minimally stable cluster.</p> <p>The 2-D and 3-D bounded numerical experiment yielded power-law distribution of both slide size and slide lifetime. This will explain the observed 1/f noise, where the power spectrum is \(S(f) \propto f^{-2+\alpha}\). Here f is the frequency of the noise, and \(\alpha\) is the power-law slope of the lifetime distribution.</p> <h3 id="waiting-time-distribution-and-astrophysical-application">Waiting Time Distribution and Astrophysical Application</h3> <p>In astrophysical events, such as gamma-ray bursts, photons are treated as originated from a point source, regardless of the spatial location of photon emission. Thus by statistics of the waiting time (the time interval between detection of two events) could be used to yield information of randomness of photon emission. If events are randomly generated, i.e. from a SOC system, the avalanche induced is fully independent of the initial perturbation. In such a case, photons all follow a Poisson distribution. For a continuously changing emission rate, the waiting time distribution is thus a superposition of separate exponential distribution, which results in many cases in a power-law WTD. While other mechanisms can also produce similar power-law properties as SOC process, they could be distinguished by the statistics of waiting time. SOC process are random and spacial independent, e.g. earthquakes. However, the aftershock occurs around each earthquake, with a Dirac-\(\delta\) like spacial distribution at each earthquakes. The influence of such spacial dependence will be reflected in WTD, i.e. for events with clusterization, the power-law slope of WTD will be \(p\sim 2\), while for gradually varying events, \(p\lesssim 3\).</p> <p>For flaring stars, the variability timescale are small, which is assumed due to flares and micro-flares. Given the low counts rate, waiting time statistics of single photons instead of each flare are studied. Another example is the black hole accretion disk, where variability timescales are at 10 ms. WTD of such peaks follow Poisson statistics, indicating the peaks originate from a SOC process. Indeed, theoretical model of reservoir agrees with the detected WTD. It is assumed that as soon as mass in the reservoir exceed a critical value, it collapses inward, inducing an avalanche and produces a peak in the light curve by Bremsstrahlung. After each big pulse, mass needs time to cumulate in the reservoir in order to produce next pulse. Though observed WTD deviates from the simple stationary Poisson process, it might not contradict to the SOC picture if modification from additional effects such as size limit, time variability and spacial inhomogeneity are considered.</p> <h3 id="waiting-time-distribution-of-grb-221009a-vhe-photons">Waiting Time Distribution of GRB 221009A VHE Photons</h3> <p>The distribution of \(dT_n = T_{n+1}-T_n\) could be fitted with a power-law function with threshold. Also, the difference of \(dT_n\), i.e. \(x_i = (dT_{i+n}-dT_i)/\sigma_i\) could be fitted with a Tsallis q-Gaussian function. For different n, the parameter of q-Gaussian function is constant, revealing some scale invariance. Yet, the WTD power-law slope \(\alpha\) and the q-Gaussian index \(q\) does not agree with the theoretical relation \(\alpha = 2/(q-1)\). As the power-law distribution is indicative of the self-organized criticality, this deviation might due to the lack of independence of photons, according to the authors.</p> <p>In a structured jet model, GRB 221009A is thought to have a Poynting-flux-dominated core and a matter-dominated wing. Photons from the core is produced by magnetic dominated processes, which corresponds to some SOC systems. Though the conclusion in this work is not very strong, it provides a new perspective of the holistic characteristics of the system as a supplement to conventional spectral and temporal analysis.</p> <p align="right">by Xingwei Gong</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="reading"/><category term="GRB"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently, Zhang et al. 2024 studied the waiting time distribution of GRB221009A afterglow VHE photons.

The tasks of LHAASO that asks for AI solutions</h2> <h3 id="background-reduction">Background Reduction</h3> <ul> <li>The gamma-ray background of LHAASO mainly consists of mis-classified cosmic rays. At present, LHAASO Collaboration reduces the background events by setting a threshold. Traditional method needs to perform a multi-dimensional optimization problem for each event in a 5-dimensional parameter space. This is not only time-consuming but also demands lots of computation resource.</li> <li>For KM2A, distinguishing gamma from protons is easier - gamma-ray air shower events produce mostly electron-positron pairs, while the latter is muon-rich. However, it’s not easy to do this on WCDA, a result from the insensitivity for muons. More often, events are categorized by its morphology. Given that proton cascade produce more secondary particles moving in random direction, the cascade is more extended than gamma events. By measuring the dispersion of secondary particles from the core position, both proton and gamma events exhibit Gaussian-like distributions, with larger mean value for protons. Thus by setting a threshold and ignore all of the events with dispersion lareger than the threshold, high classification purity is achieved at the cost of lower selection efficiency. </li> <li>The goal of using AI tools is to reduce the cosmic ray background by a factor of 2-5. This might not be a great improvement for bright sources like crab, but for faint targets, i.e. flux equivalent to 0.01 crab, reducing background is of great importance in enhancing significance of detection.</li> </ul> <h3 id="particle-categorization">Particle Categorization</h3> <p></p> <ul> <li>There are 26 different categories of cosmic ray particles, from H to Fe. Theoretically, these events have different location of cascade maxima, thus could be classified according to observations of WFCTA. This is however almost impossible in practise due to low quality of WFCTA imaging and the influence of cascade location and observation angle.</li> </ul> <h3 id="noise-reduction">Noise Reduction</h3> <ul> <li>Noise is quite common for both ED, MD and WCD. Assuming that secondary particles from a single event arrive at a flat surface in the space of x,y and t, noise outside this surface could be reduced. However, this will certainly exclude some signals, and noise in the surface is not distinguishable.</li> </ul> <h3 id="event-reconstruction">Event Reconstruction</h3> <ul> <li>Event reconstruction is highly dependent on air shower simulations. Detector array can only do discrete sampling of signals. If AI tools can do some kind of “interpolation” but with prior knowledge from simulations, the reconstruction error will be smaller.</li> </ul> <h3 id="multiple-source-analysis">Multiple Source Analysis</h3> <ul> <li>Near the milky way, source is dense and overlap, posing challenge to source identification.

The new observation shows significant soft X-ray absorption features along with Fe K absorption lines that already observed in previous works. The lines in the new observation could be well explained by absorption from ultra-fast outflow. The separate spectral fitting of two components, soft X-ray absorber and iron K absorber, yield same outflow velocity of \(\sim -0.25c\), consistent with previous studies of this source. The soft X-ray component shows strong variability while the iron K absorber is relative stable within the \(\sim 20\) day period of the two 2019 observations, indicating the two absorption features originate from diferent distances. The author gave theoretical interpretations of the observed features. This work is observational paper which could be rated as good. The conclusion of ultra fast outflow is strong, and calls for further investigation of this source with more advanced instruments like XRISM and ATHENA.</p> <h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2> <p>PDS 456 is a luminous quasar with redshift \(z = 0.184\). Previous observations reveals the existence of iron K-shell absorption line profile with outflow velocity of \(\sim 0.25c\). It has been claimed that high-velocity iron K winds might be common in nearby AGNs due to numerous observations (e.g. APM 08279+5255, PG 1211+143). However, the detection of blue-shifted absorption lines in soft X-ray band is relatively rare. For the source PDS 456, soft X-ray outflow with lower ionization has been confirmed with the archival XMM-Newton observations. Soft X-ray fast winds has been reported in a few other sources, such as IRAS 13224-3809 and 1H 0707-495. There were also examples of co-existing soft X-ray and Fe K winds with consistent velocity, e.g. PG 1211+143 with \(v \sim -0.06c\) and IRAS 13224-3809 with \(v \sim 0.24c\). Despite the increasing observations, the correlation between iron K wind and soft X-ray wind was still poorly understood. This paper is motivated by three XMM-Newton observations, one in 2018 and two in 2019. The latter two observations were carried out with an interval \(\sim 20\) days. This provides a chance to examine the variability timescale of the outflow wind, providing constraints on the location, size and density. Furthermore, these new observations have resolved both the soft X-ray component and the iron K absorber, enabling detailed investigation of the exact relation between these two components.</p> <h2 id="data-and-methods">Data and Methods</h2> <p>The 2018 XMM-Newton observation was made on Sep.9, with 86 ks exposure, along with HST and NuSTAR observations. Observation 2019a was on Sep. 2, with 83 ks exposure, simultaneous with HST observation. 2019b was made on Sep 24., about 20 days after 2019a. This observation has 94 ks exposure and conducted simultaneously with NuSTAR. The 2018 observation is in the bright state, with energy flux \(F= 9.4\times 10^{-12}\) ergs cm, \(^{-2}s^{-1}\) at 2-10 keV. The soft X-ray spectrum of 2018 observation is featureless, while the hard X-ray spectrum extends to \(&gt; 50\)keV according to NuSTAR observation. Being about 5 times fainter than 2018 observation, both 2019 observations demonstrate Fe K absorption profile at 7-10 keV and soft X-ray absorption features, while 2019b is more significant. Interestingly, Swift monitoring shows that 2019a is almost at the state with minimum flux.</p> <p>The author mainly fitted the 2019b spectrum to investigate the properties of soft X-ray absorber. They first used gaussian-like profile to locate the three most significant absorption lines, then fitted it with blue-shifted photoionization model (XSTAR) with solar abundance. In addition to the fast outflow, they also tried fitting with models of low velocity shift, which was badly fitted and thus ruled out the latter assumption. In the broad-band fitting, the author also used XSTAR to identify the iron K absorption features – the 9 keV trough and the 10.2 keV trough. The former one is probably due too Fe XXVI Ly\(\alpha\) absorption line, with velocity shift consistent with the soft X-ray component; the latter requires a second faster wind component, with outflow velocity \(v \sim 0.36c\).</p> <h2 id="results-and-conclusion">Results and Conclusion</h2> <h3 id="soft-x-ray-absorber-spectral-fitting">Soft X-ray Absorber Spectral Fitting</h3> <p>At soft X-ray band, the fit with a power-law model with galactic absorption is poor, and there are absorption profiles in addition to the continuum. With three Gaussian profile, the fit was significantly improved. With the a priori knowledge that outflow velocity might be \(-0.25-0.3c\), the Gaussian absorption lines could be identified as OIII Ly\(\alpha\) (18.97 \(\AA\) ), Ne IX He\(\alpha\) (13.45 \(\AA\) ) and Ne X Ly\(\alpha\) (12.13 \(\AA\) ). All the three lines give a common velocity shift of \(v/c = -0.257\), in agreement with the previous studies. The fitting using photoionization model XSTAR further improves the fitting, with the expense of 3 extra free parameters. The fitting yield a ionization parameter \(\log\xi = 3.4\), column density \(N_H = 2.3\times 10^21\)cm\(^{-3}\), and a covering factor \(f_{\mathrm{cov}} = 0.92^{+0.08}_{-0.32}\). In order to confirm the outflow explanation, the author further fitted the soft X-ray spectrum with absorber of zero or small velocity shift. The EW upperlimit of lines, constrained by the non-detection of the accompanying lines, is significantly weaker than observation, thus the zero-blueshifit scenario could be ruled out.</p> <h3 id="fe-k-line-fitting">Fe K Line Fitting</h3> <p>The Fe K absorption line at 9 keV restframe could be identified with Fe XXVI Ly\(\alpha\), with velocity shift \(-0.25\pm 0.02c\), in perfect agreement with the soft X-ray absorber. The absorption trough at \(\sim 10.2\) keV cannot be explained by the same outflow, thus might calling for an additional absorption component with \(v= 0.36c\). Compared with soft X-ray wind, the Fe K absorber exhibit higher ionization parameter \(\log \xi = 5.0\), almost two orders of manitude larger than the soft X-ray wind. Its column density is also larger (\(N_H = 7\times 10^{23}\) cm\(^{-3}\)).</p> <h3 id="interpretation">Interpretation</h3> <p>The 2018 observation has a 2-10 keV flux 4 times stronger than 2019b. By fitting the 2018a observation with same photoionization model, ionization parameter \(\log \xi\) is 4 times stronger than 2019b, which corresponds to the flux variability. Meanwhile, the 2019a observation has lower ionization factor due to the low flux, and the best-fit column density is higher. By another fit with neutral partial covering absorber, the zero-blueshift scenario was ruled out.</p> <p>In this work, the author gave self-consistent estimations of the location and size of the soft X-ray absorber with observations 2019a and 2019b. Both observations result in \(\sim\) parsec distance from central BH estimated by the ionization luminosity and covering fraction. Interestingly, the assumption of 20-day variation timescale gave an estimate of absorber size \(\Delta R \sim 10^{15}-10^{16}\)cm, also agrees with the covering fraction. The soft X-ray absorber is believed to locate outside the high-ionization Fe K absorber, and possibly originate from the ultra-fast outflow. The mass outflow rate for a uniform soft X-ray wind exceeds the upper limit set by accretion rate, a strong implication of its clumpy nature, explaining the fast variability of column density and ionization parameter.</p> <h2 id="scientific-significance">Scientific Significance</h2> <p>This work contributes to the understanding of the correlation between absorbers in soft X-ray band and iron K band. With spectral fitting, the author built a clear physical picture of relative location of the two components, and gave interpretation of the observed features during three different times.</p> <p>This work not only enhances the understanding of the source PDS 456, but also have profound impact on larger topics. The discovery of the clumpy absorber provides observational evidence for the hypothesis that X-ray wind originate from the post-shock interstellar medium interacting with the ultra-fast outflow. The estimated outflow rate and filling fraction also hints on the possible role in energy feedback to the galaxy that the soft X-ray wind might play.</p> <h2 id="key-factor-leading-to-conclusion">Key Factor Leading to Conclusion</h2> <p>The observations in different state of PDS 456 made it possible to estimate the properties and locations of the absorption components. The authors have published several papers discussing about PDS 456. Along with the three observations mainly introduced in this paper, previous multi-wavelength observations of this source, and other objects exhibiting similar absorption features are also crucial in getting the conclusion.</p> <h2 id="possibilities-of-improvement">Possibilities of Improvement</h2> <p>The size \(\Delta R\) is estimated based on the covering fraction \(f_{\mathrm{cov}} &gt; 0.6\) for 2019b, that the soft X-ray wind has comparable size with corona. However, I doubt whether this transverse scale could be directly applied in estimation of the number density along the line of sight. If the outflow is intermittent, line of sight depth may vary and dependent on the morphology of the wind. Though a spherical approximation suffice for a rough estimate, it could be improved regarding the light curve monitored by Swift.</p> <p>Besides, PDS 456 is in the PV source list of XRISM. With unprecedented spectral resolution and sensitivity, there is no doubt that the new observation will provide evidences supporting or against the conclusions in this work.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="reading"/><category term="AGN"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This reading report is part of the AGN coursework.
